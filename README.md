# Gender-Classification


The Gender classification is gaining more and more attention, as gender contains rich and distinguished information about the social activities of men and women. Gender classification aims to recognize a personâ€™s gender based on the characteristics that differentiate masculinity and femininity.

In the field of artificial intelligence, gender classification is considered to be one of the most important applications of the pattern recognition method. Advances in gender classification research have led to many potential applications.

For example, a computer system with gender recognition functions has a wide range of applications in the fields of basic and applied research, including human-computer interaction, security industry and surveillance, demographic research, business development, mobile applications and video games.

Also, multiple mechanisms are proposed to improve the performance of gender recognition in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
